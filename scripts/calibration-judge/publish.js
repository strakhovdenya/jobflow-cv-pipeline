// verification read does not find it is retried from the top — re-read,
// re-merge, re-write — rather than merely re-verified, since the comment
// could have been replaced entirely by a concurrent run between the write
// and the verify read. Exhausting `maxAttempts` returns a failure rather
// than throwing, so the caller (the CLI) turns it into a plain non-zero

// this function makes no network call itself (INV-3) — the real caller
// backs them with `gh api` calls using array arguments. This narrows but
// does not eliminate the race: a write can still land in the gap between
// the recheck read and the write call itself, since plain `gh api` offers no
// conditional/compare-and-swap write.
