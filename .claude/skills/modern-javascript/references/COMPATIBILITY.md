## Decide the compatibility path

1. Read the project's actual targets: `engines`, `browserslist`, deployment images, Electron/runtime versions, and bundler/test configuration.
2. Classify the feature as syntax, a built-in API, a host API, or a combination.
3. Prefer a native standardized feature when every supported target has it.
4. Otherwise choose and document a runtime upgrade, syntax transform, polyfill, or fallback algorithm.
5. Test the oldest supported target. A modern development machine proves very little about production compatibility.

Do not use an edition label as a runtime guarantee. Engines ship features before and after annual ECMA-262 publication.

## Transforms are not polyfills

| Kind | Example | What is required |
|---|---|---|
| Syntax only | decorators | Babel/TypeScript must parse and emit compatible JavaScript |
| Syntax plus protocol built-ins | `using` / `await using` | Transform plus `Symbol.dispose`, stacks, and related built-ins when the emitted helper/runtime needs them |
| Built-in only | `Map.prototype.getOrInsert` | Runtime support or a polyfill |
| Namespace API | Temporal | Runtime support or a Temporal polyfill |
| Host API | `fetch`, `structuredClone` | Host/runtime package or application-specific fallback; not an ECMAScript polyfill decision |

Raising TypeScript's `target` or adding `lib: ["esnext"]` changes syntax emit and available types. It does **not** install `Iterator.concat`, Temporal, or any other runtime API.

## Babel

Use `@babel/preset-env` with explicit targets for standardized syntax. For proposal syntax, pin the proposal revision instead of accepting an implicit default.

### Standard decorators

TC39 currently tracks decorators at Stage 2.7, but the proposal has a mature transform ecosystem. Babel's current proposal snapshot is selected explicitly:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators", { "version": "2023-11" }]
  ]
}
```

Do not combine this with legacy decorators accidentally. Babel's `legacy` mode and TypeScript's `experimentalDecorators` implement older, incompatible semantics. If decorators use `context.metadata`, load a compatible `Symbol.metadata` polyfill before decorated code.

### Explicit resource management

`@babel/plugin-transform-explicit-resource-management` transforms `using` and `await using` and is included in current preset-env data. The transform does not by itself make every related built-in available. Add a tested runtime/polyfill path when code directly uses `DisposableStack`, `AsyncDisposableStack`, or the well-known disposal symbols.

### Polyfill injection

Babel major versions differ:

- Babel 8 directs users from preset-env's old `useBuiltIns` option to `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`.
- Existing Babel 7 projects may already use `useBuiltIns` with core-js.

Inspect the installed major and its official documentation before changing configuration. Do not add both strategies and duplicate polyfills.

## TypeScript 7 and TypeScript 6

[TypeScript 7.0 was released on 2026-07-08](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-7-0/). It is the native compiler port, not a new JavaScript runtime and not a polyfill.

Important 7.0 boundaries:

- It has a production `tsc`, but no stable programmatic compiler API in 7.0.
- Tools that embed the compiler or language service may still require TypeScript 6. The TypeScript team documents side-by-side installation with `@typescript/typescript6`.
- Angular template tooling and Vue/MDX/Astro/Svelte integrations may still require TypeScript 6 until their integrations support the new API.
- TypeScript 7 changed several defaults and removed legacy targets/options. Read the official migration notes before treating it as a drop-in toolchain upgrade.

For syntax compatibility:

- Standard-style decorators are supported by TypeScript 5.0+ without `experimentalDecorators`. The TC39 proposal is now Stage 2.7, so lock tests to the compiler version and do not claim native standard status.
- Explicit resource management was added in TypeScript 5.2. The emitted compatibility code still relies on the disposal protocol; supply the declared libs and runtime support/polyfills that the target requires.
- TypeScript 6 added Temporal type declarations under `esnext` / `esnext.temporal`. Those declarations do not provide Temporal at runtime.

Use Babel or another dedicated emitter when a project's required syntax transform is not supported by its chosen TypeScript 7 path. Keep TypeScript for checking with `noEmit` if that separation is simpler.

## Runtime polyfills

### core-js

Current core-js provides modules for all seven ES2026 feature groups, including:

- `Array.fromAsync`
- `Error.isError`
- `Math.sumPrecise`
- Uint8Array base64/hex conversion
- `Iterator.concat`
- Map/WeakMap `getOrInsert` methods
- JSON source access and raw JSON

It also provides proposal modules for explicit resource management and modules for `Iterator.zip` / `zipKeyed`. Prefer target-driven injection for applications; use selective imports for libraries only when the library's compatibility contract permits global patching.

Examples of selective application imports:

```javascript
import 'core-js/actual/iterator/concat';
import 'core-js/actual/map/get-or-insert';
import 'core-js/actual/typed-array/from-base64';
```

Pin and test the current core-js version in the project. A polyfill can match API behavior but cannot reproduce engine performance characteristics.

### Temporal

Temporal is too large to treat as a casual utility import. Prefer a runtime that ships it. Otherwise choose a maintained implementation listed by the [TC39 Temporal repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal#polyfills), and account for bundle cost, calendar coverage, API parity, and the project's release-stability policy.

TC39's table labels these releases as follows, checked 2026-08-13:

| Package | Upstream release label |
|---|---|
| `temporal-polyfill` | Stable |
| `temporal-polyfill-lite` | Release candidate |
| `@js-temporal/polyfill` | Alpha |

These are dated upstream labels, not permanent rankings. Recheck them before choosing. The stable package supports a local ponyfill import, which avoids changing the global in a library:

```javascript
import { Temporal } from 'temporal-polyfill';

const today = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO();
```

Avoid silently assigning a ponyfill to `globalThis.Temporal` in a library. Let the application own that global policy.

### No faithful polyfill

`Atomics.pause` is an engine/shared-memory primitive. A normal JavaScript library cannot reproduce its execution hint faithfully. Feature-detect it and retain a different backoff strategy when unavailable.

## Current support snapshot

First unflagged versions from [MDN Browser Compatibility Data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data), checked 2026-08-13. `partial` means the implementation has the BCD caveat described below.

### ES2026

| Feature | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Node.js |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `Array.fromAsync` | 121 | 115 | 16.4 | 22.0.0 |
| `Error.isError` | 134 | 138 | 18.4 partial | 24.3.0 |
| `Math.sumPrecise` | 147 | 137 | 26.2 | No current support recorded |
| Uint8Array base64/hex | 140 | 133 | 18.2 | 25.0.0 |
| `Iterator.concat` | 146 | 147 | 26.4 | 26.0.0 |
| Map/WeakMap upsert | 145 | 144 | 26.2 | 26.0.0 |
| JSON parse source/raw JSON | 114 | 135 | 18.4 | 21.0.0 |

Safari 18.4's `Error.isError` returns `false` for `DOMException`; BCD therefore marks it partial. Node 24.0-24.2 had the same limitation and is complete from 24.3.

### Stage 4, expected ES2027

| Feature | Native position | Compatibility path |
|---|---|---|
| Temporal | Chrome 144, Firefox 139, official Node 26 binaries; Safari preview | Dedicated Temporal polyfill |
| Explicit resource management | Chrome 134, Firefox 141, Node 24; no stable Safari support recorded | Babel/TypeScript transform plus core-js protocol built-ins as needed |
| `Atomics.pause` | Chrome 133, Firefox 137, Safari 18.4; no Node support recorded | Feature-detected fallback algorithm |
| `Iterator.zip` / `zipKeyed` | Limited native support | current core-js modules |

Do not turn these numbers into a universal baseline. Electron, embedded WebViews, serverless images, test runners, and bundlers may lag their upstream engine.

Node 26's official binaries enable Temporal by default. Custom and distributor builds can omit it: Node's build probes for the required Rust toolchain and disables Temporal when the prerequisites are absent unless the builder explicitly requires it. Feature-detect `globalThis.Temporal` instead of trusting `process.versions.node` alone.

## Feature detection

Use detection when shipping one artifact across mixed runtimes:

```javascript
const sum = typeof Math.sumPrecise === 'function'
  ? Math.sumPrecise(values)
  : compensatedSum(values);

const pause = typeof Atomics.pause === 'function'
  ? () => Atomics.pause()
  : () => {};
```

Feature detection answers whether a property exists, not whether an old implementation has every current semantic fix. For security- or correctness-sensitive behavior, pin the runtime or run a behavior test.
